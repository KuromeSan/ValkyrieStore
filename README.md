# ValkyrieStore
Firefox extension to allow the old "Valkyrie" playstation store to be loaded and used-


PSST- Sony, maybe make your new store not suck rather than removing the better one?


== Build ==
1) download src
2) zip it
3) rename zip to xpi 


XPI Extensions have to be signed by mozilla in order for them to work in the normal mozilla firefox-

u can load unsigned extensions using Firefox Developer Edition and changing some flags in about:config.
and u can load them temporarily by clicking the settings cog thing and doing "Debug Add Ons" then "Load Extension" where it'll work until u restart the browser.
