# ValkyrieStore
Firefox extension to allow the old "Valkyrie" playstation store to be loaded and used-


1) download src
2) base64 encode oldStore.html
3) replace universalLoader with new b64 data
4) zip it
5) rename zip to xpi 


psst- sony.... maybe instead of removing it you could make your new store not suck? j-just a thought
